## Lab 2 Blog:

1. I read about the four criteria for free software:
 * Freedom to run the program for any purpose.
 * Freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
 * Freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
 * Freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes.

2. It is important to choose a license because:
 * Without one, you'd have "all rights reserved." Thus making your code inaccessible. Others will not be able to benefit from your software since they cannot legally use, study, modify, or redistribute it.

3. First of all, people shouldn't use a project/software that doesn't have an explicit license because it is illegal. Technically the developers have "all rights reserved" if the software doesn't have a license. Thus rendering people unable to view or use source code of project.
