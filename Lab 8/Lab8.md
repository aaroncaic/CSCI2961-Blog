## Lab 8 Blog

#### Installation & Tutorial
1. For this lab, I installed `Networkx` located [here](https://networkx.github.io/ using GitHub clone method).
2. After Networkx, I attempted to install `matplotlib` but I ran out of memory on my virtual box.
3. To get familiar with `Networkx`, I worked through the [tutorial](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/latest/_downloads/networkx_tutorial.pdf) until I felt comfortable.

#### Read & Understand
4. The wordladder [implementation](https://github.com/networkx/networkx/blob/master/examples/graph/words.py) provided to us was relatively simple and easy to understand.
5. I tested the code for the following words:
    1.   `chaos` to `order`
    2.   `nodes` to `graph`
    3.   `moron` to `smart`
    4.   `pound` to `marks`

#### Gitstats
1. Screenshot:

 * From what I can tell the stats from Gitstats are pretty much the same from my findings in part 1, though the number of lines of code differ by 3.
