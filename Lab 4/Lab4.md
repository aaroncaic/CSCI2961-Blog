## Lab 4 Blog:

* For this lab assignment, I chose to work with the OpenBSD documentation.
 * I managed to find a simple typo in section 13.7 ("How do I use my MIDI instruments?").
 * In that section, the word 'handy' was spelled incorrectly. It was spelled 'handly' instead of 'handy' (or 'handily').

* Link to my commit request email: http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-tech&m=144305425101467&w=2
