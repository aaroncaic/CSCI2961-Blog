## Lab 4 Blog:

* For this lab assignment, I chose to work with the OpenBSD documentation.
 * I managed to find a simple typo in section 13.7 ("How do I use my MIDI instruments?").
 * In that section, the word 'handy' was spelled incorrectly. It was spelled 'handly' instead of 'handy' (or 'handily').

##### Why it is important to maintain good documentation?
 * I think it's important to maintain a good documentation because it would make the lives of users much easier, especially new ones.  They can find answers or instructions conveniently and a lot quicker.  If the documentation is unorganized, not informative, or contains a lot of errors, then it would make it almost impossible for users to read and understand it.
