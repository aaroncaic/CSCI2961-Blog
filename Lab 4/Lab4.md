## Lab 4 Blog:

* For this lab assignment, I chose to work with the OpenBSD documentation.
 * I managed to find a simple typo in section 13.7 ("How do I use my MIDI instruments?").
 * In that section, the word 'handy' was spelled incorrectly. It was spelled 'handly' instead of 'handy' (or 'handily').


#### Why it is important to maintain good documentation?
 * I think it's important to maintain a good documentation because it would make the lives of users much easier, especially new ones.  They can find answers or instructions conveniently and a lot quicker.  If the documentation is unorganized, not informative, or contains a lot of errors, then it would make it almost impossible for users to read and understand it.

#### What you have learned from this lab?
 * I learned that even large projects like FreeBSD and OpenBSD can still make simple mistakes.
 * I also realized that contributing (or at least an attempt) to a large scale project can be quite satifying.





### Open Source VS Proprietary Software
#### Proprietary
* ##### Pros:
  * Usually very reliable and stable.
  * Less bugs.
  * Secure.
  * User friendly.

* ##### Cons:
 * Not free, usually expensive.
 * Not very flexible or customizable.
 * Cannot read or modify source code.
 * Users have no say in development.

#### Open Source
* ##### Pros:
  * Flexible and customizable.
  * Free!
  * Unified and fun community (usually).
  * Can read and modify source code.
  * Can constribute to software.

* ##### Cons:
 * A lot of bugs (usually).
 * Not user friendly.
 * Must put in effort to find answers/instructions.
 
* Generally, companies would go for proprietary software because of its reliability and stability. Companies obviously wouldn't want to use software that has a lot of bugs or hard to use because they need stability and efficiency.
* Individuals would most likely use open source software mainly because of its adaptability. Plus it's free!  The software can be modified or customized to suit the individuals' needs.  Even though individuals may encounter many bugs, they're still generally less impatient and less demanding than companies, thus they would most likely choose open source. However, it really comes down to preference in the end!
